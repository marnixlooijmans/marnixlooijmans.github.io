        <b>Profile</b><br>
        I have a keen interest in cosmology, neutrino physics, quantum computing and artificial intelligence.
        I am currently working on building a career where I can do research in these fields and ideally learn more about the interplay of these fields.
        As a pastime, I am also interested in space exploration.<br>
